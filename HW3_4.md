## data input

First, we input the data and required package, then standardized the
`totalRooms` and `totalBedrooms` by the households.

Also, I will continue split dataset into two section.

## Tree model

### CART model

we first use CART model, include all variable exclude `longitude` and
`latitude`, When we were building the model, we split only if that tree
have at least 30 obs in a node, and the split improves the fit by a
factor of 0.00001.

our tree models are (we include standardized `totalRooms` and
`totalBedrooms` :
`rpart(medianHouseValue ~ . - longitude -  latitude - totalRooms - totalBedrooms)`

we can get the tree plot and cross-validated error as:

Then use function to pick the smallest tree, and get the minimum rmse:

    ## [1] 77455.53

### random forests

we use random forests to do the estimation, based on same dependent
variables, and we get its RMSE:

    ## [1] 67631.28

#### gradient-boosted trees

we use gradient-boosted trees model to do the estimation, based on same
dependent variables, and we get its RMSE. now we average over 100
bootstrap samples, this time use all candidate variables (mtry=6) in
each bootstrapped sample

    ## [1] 68398.82

so we can see that random forest has smaller rmse, we will continue use
random forest model to estimate the `medianHouseValue`

### predict the result and make plots

#### a plot of the original data

we can get the plot result as:
![](HW3_4_files/figure-markdown_strict/show%20original%20data%20plot-1.png)

#### a plot of your model’s predictions of medianHouseValue

![](HW3_4_files/figure-markdown_strict/show%20predictions%20plot-1.png)

#### a plot of your model’s errors

![](HW3_4_files/figure-markdown_strict/show%20the%20residuals-1.png)

So overall, we can see that our estimations are higher than the real
value, it always happen in southern area of CA.
